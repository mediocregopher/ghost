# ghost example

A simple client and server that use ghost to do a bit of one-way communication.
You may have to change the import statements depending on how you've got ghost
installed.

# Usage

Call `go run` on each script individually. Order doesn't actually matter, and
you should be able to kill either script and bring it back up and have things
resume normally fairly quickly.
