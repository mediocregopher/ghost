# ghost example

A simple client and server that use ghost to do a bit of one-way communication.
You may have to change the import statements depending on how you've got ghost
installed.

# Usage

Call `go run` on each script individually, first the server then the client.
After starting them you should be able to kill either script and bring it back
up and have things go back to normal fairly quickly.
